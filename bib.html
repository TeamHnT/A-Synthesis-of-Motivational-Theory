            <div class="offset-lg-1 col-md-10 col-lg-5 sub-text">
              <p>Maslow's theory of motivation divides human needs into 5 broad subcategories. A need precedes another from the lowest to the highest category, as pictured. This order may vary according to cultural specificities. Each level of needs monopolizes consciousness and influence behaviour.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-5">
              <h2>phisiological</h2>
                <p>Physiological needs are the essence of functioning of the human body and include the basic elements for our survival — water, air, food and sleep.</p>
              <h2>safety</h5>
                <p>Safety implies the need for protecting self from harm. These needs extend to a safe enviornment to reside in, a job to provide for health and shelter.</p>
              <h2>love</h2>
              <p>The need for affection and belonging.</p>
              <h2>self esteem</h2>
                <p>The satisfaction of this need leads to feelings of self-confidence, worth, strength, capability and adequacy of being useful and necessary in the world.</p>
              <h2>self actualization</h2>
                <p>This need refers to the desire for self-fulfilment, to the tendency for him to become actualised in what he is potentially. Even if allt hese needs are satisfied, we may still often expect that a new discontent and restlessness will soon develop, unless the individual isDoing what he is fitted for.</p>

              <h2>MANAGEMENT BY CONTROL (X)</h2>
              <p>Traditionally, control was accepted in organizations management as a mean to motivate workers in early stages of industrialization, when basic human needs were still lacking. We could say that Theory X was then <i>en vogue</i>.</p>
              <p>Back then, individuals were seen as passive beings, indolent and lacking ambition, thus unable to modify their behaviour to fit a company's goals. Controlling their actions to motivate them, often with coercive methods, was a manager's duty.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-5">
              <h2>MANAGEMENT BY OBJECTIVES (Y)</h2>
                <p>However, society’s development for 'higher needs', like social contact and ego satisfaction, proved this philosophy to be wrong for people’s management. McGregor reflects upon <b>Maslow's hierarchy of needs</b>, acknowledging that as 'lower needs' were satisfied in progressively industrialized societies, motivation should come from fulfilling other needs in the workplace. Theory Y came into place. <b>Perspectives on human motivations were shifting.</b> Individuals should no longer be seen as naturally passive or resistant to organizational needs - they have become so as a result of the workplace environment.</p>
                <p>Therefore, it should be of management's responsibility to arrange conditions so that people can achieve their own goals (by self-control & self - direction), directing their efforts toward organizational objectives.</p>

              <p>Concerning <b>motivation in the workplace</b>, Herzberg considered job satisfaction as two separate continuums: the presence of one set of job attributes (motivators) lead to job satisfaction while the absence of a completely different set of job attributes (hygiene factors) lead to job dissatisfaction.</p>
              <p>Until Herzberg, job satisfaction was considered as a single continuum represented by satisfaction and dissatisfaction at the two opposing extremes. For the Two Factor Theory, the opposite of dissatisfaction is no dissatisfaction, whereas the opposite of satisfaction is no satisfaction.</p>

              <h2>motivators</h2>
              <p>Labeled as low sequence events, these  cause job satisfaction when present and cause no dissatisfaction when absent.

              <p>The Self-Determination Theory distinguishes two kinds of motivation: <b>intrinsic and extrinsic motivation</b> (as well as amotivation). With intrinsic motivation, a person does something because it’s interesting or enjoyable which results in high-level learning and creativity. With extrinsic motivation, a person does something because it leads to a separable outcome,  with different levels of self-endorsement.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-5">
              <h2>Intrinsic motivation</h2>
              <p>When a person is intrinsically motivated, he does something because of the satisfaction caused by it rather than for the consequences from that activity. The person does something for the fun or challenge, rather than because of external prods.</p>
              <p>There are four types of intrinsic motivation:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>IM to know</b>, as ofDoing something for the pleasure of learning;</li>
                  <li><b>IM to accomplish things</b>, as ofDoing something for the pleasure of trying to accomplish something;</li>
                  <li><b>IM to experience stimulation</b>, as ofDoing something to experience stimulating sensations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>What they have in common are the feelings of autonomy, competence, and relatedness, features mainly provided in more intrinsic types of motivation. A <b>sense of relatedness</b> stands for the level of sharing a task with people who matter for that fact.</p>
              <h2>entrinsic motivation</h2>
                <p>This a construct that pertains whenever an activity is done in order to attain some separable outcome, so it holdes an instrumental value.</p>
                <p>There are different levels of external and internal factors for extrinsic motivation:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>External regulation</b>, whenDoing something for the reward you get from it;</li>
                    <li><b>Introjected regulation</b>, as ofDoing something because of social pressure or to avoid a feeling of guilt;</li>
                    <li><b>Identification</b>, as of consciously valuing an activity, which ultimately leads to higher levels of self-endorsement;</li>
                    <li><b>Integration</b>, when some task is fully assimilated by the individual and he can no longer separate it from the self.</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>Senses of relatedness, competence and autonomy facilitate the internalization in extrinsic motivation. <i>"The primary reason people are likely to be willing to do the behaviours is that they are valued by significant others to whom they feel (or would like to feel) connected”.</i></p>
